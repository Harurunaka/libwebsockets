\subsection*{Library is a component }

As a library, lws is just a component in a bigger application.

Many users are able to share their sources, but others decide not to, for \char`\"{}commerical advantage\char`\"{} or whatever.

This makes answering questions like \char`\"{}what is wrong with my code I am not
going to show you?\char`\"{} very difficult.

Even if it\textquotesingle{}s clear there is a problem somewhere, it cannot be understood or reproduced by anyone else if it needs user code that isn\textquotesingle{}t provided.

The biggest question is, \char`\"{}is this an lws problem actually\char`\"{}?

\subsection*{Use the test apps as sanity checks }

The test server and client are extremely useful for sanity checks and debugging guidance.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item test apps work on your platform, then either
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item your user code is broken, align it to how the test apps work, or,
\item something from your code is required to show an lws problem, provide a minimal patch on a test app so it can be reproduced
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item test apps break on your platform, but work on, eg, x86\+\_\+64, either
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item toolchain or platform-\/specific (eg, OS) issue, or
\item lws platform support issue
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item test apps break everywhere
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sounds like lws problem, info to reproduce and / or a patch is appreciated 
\end{DoxyItemize}
