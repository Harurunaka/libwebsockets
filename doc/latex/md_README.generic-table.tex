\subsubsection*{Column layout}

When the ws connection is established, the protocol should send a J\+S\+ON message describing the table columns. For example


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 msg = "\{\(\backslash\)"cols\(\backslash\)":["
2       "  \{\(\backslash\)"name\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"Date\(\backslash\)"\},"
3       "  \{\(\backslash\)"name\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"Size\(\backslash\)", \(\backslash\)"align\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"right\(\backslash\)"\},"
4       "  \{\(\backslash\)"name\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"Icon\(\backslash\)"\},"
5       "  \{\(\backslash\)"name\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"Name\(\backslash\)", \(\backslash\)"href\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"uri\(\backslash\)"\},"
6       "  \{\(\backslash\)"name\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"uri\(\backslash\)", \(\backslash\)"hide\(\backslash\)": \(\backslash\)"1\(\backslash\)" \}"
7       " ]"
8       "\}";
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This describes 5 columns
\item Only four columns (not \char`\"{}uri\char`\"{}) should be visible
\item \char`\"{}\+Name\char`\"{} should be presented as a clickable link using \char`\"{}uri\char`\"{} as the destination, when a \char`\"{}uri\char`\"{} field is presented.
\item \char`\"{}\+Size\char`\"{} field should be presented aligned to the right
\end{DoxyItemize}
